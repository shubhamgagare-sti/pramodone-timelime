## Critical Path Items

> [!WARNING]
> **Blockers & Dependencies**
>
> The following items are critical for maintaining the February 20 timeline:

1. **Timely Clarifications Required:**
   - Detailed requirements for subcontractor billing workflow
   - Detailed requirements for client billing workflow
   - Business rules for accounts-site-store linking
   - Salary calculation and payment rules

2. **Demonstration Scheduling:**
   - Need to schedule accounts and billing workflow demonstration
   - Stakeholder availability for review sessions
   - Feedback turnaround time

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Accounting ↔ Site linking
   - Accounting ↔ Central Store linking
   - Accounting ↔ Salary module
   - Billing ↔ Accounting integration

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Delayed requirement clarifications | High | Early scheduling of demonstration sessions |
| Complex integration requirements | Medium | Modular design with clear interfaces |
| Scope creep in billing modules | High | Clear requirements documentation before implementation |
| Testing time constraints | Medium | Parallel testing during development |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Complete accounting module core functionality
   - Prepare demonstration environment for workflow review
   - Document current accounts and billing workflow

2. **This Week:**
   - Schedule demonstration session with stakeholders
   - Finalize accounting module implementation
   - Begin integration with site and central store

3. **Pending Decisions:**
   - Exact workflow for subcontractor billing
   - Exact workflow for client billing
   - Rate analysis update specifications
   - Salary implementation details

## Communication Plan

- **Weekly Status Updates:** Every Monday
- **Demonstration Sessions:** As scheduled with stakeholders
- **Daily Standups:** For development team
- **Issue Escalation:** Immediate notification for blockers
